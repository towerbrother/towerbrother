Hi 👋, I’m Giorgio!

I'm an :it:/:gb: software developer, currently based in Munich, Germany. Shifting from project management to software development was a conscious choice driven by my desire to be hands-on and create impactful solutions. I'm passionate about problem-solving and take immense satisfaction in seeing my work benefit hundreds, if not thousands, of users.

I’m currently working with Next.js, TypeScript and Redux. I'm eager to always learn and improve. I value flexibility and independence in my work. I am known for my strong communication skills, project ownership and collaborative nature. Embracing challenges as opportunities and a relentless pursuit of excellence and success define my approach.
