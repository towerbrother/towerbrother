Hi 👋, I’m Giorgio!

I'm an :it:/:gb: software developer, currently based in Munich, Germany. 

Shifting from project management to software development was a conscious choice driven by my desire to be hands-on and create impactful solutions. I'm passionate about problem-solving and take immense satisfaction in seeing my work benefit hundreds, if not thousands, of users.

I’m currently working with Next.js, TypeScript and Redux. I'm refreshing/improving my Node.js and algorithms/data-structures knowledge in my free time... I'm eager to always learn and improve 📓. 

I value flexibility and independence in my work. I am known for my strong communication skills, project ownership and collaborative nature. Embracing challenges as opportunities and a relentless pursuit of excellence and success define my approach.
